# pysome
Python Social Media application


On April 10th 2022, I will be starting a #100DaysofCode in #python to complete an application called Pysome (python social media). This application will help small businesses schedule posts in twitter, facebook and linkedin with text and pictures. I will share the code in github everyday.
