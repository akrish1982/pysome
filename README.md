# pysome
**Py**thon **So**cial **Me**dia application


On April 10th 2022, I will be starting a #100DaysofCode in #python to complete an application called Pysome (python social media). This application will help small businesses schedule posts in twitter, facebook and linkedin with text and pictures. I will share the code in github everyday.

- **Use Case 1** 
- A Python program to read text from an excel sheet & Write text into a image. these would be used by use case 2
  - A list of questions and answers are available to read
  - The program needs to write text into image and save as jpeg
  - Dynamically needs to adjust the font size to fit the image

- **Use Case 2** 
- An user interface to update text and upload images that can be scheduled to post on twitter, facebook, linkedin and instagram
  - A Python Script to post image & text with text on the Facebook wall & Facebook Groups you are member.
  - A Python Script to post image from step 1 with text on twitter.
  - A Python Script to post image from step 1 with text on Linkedin wall & Linkedin Groups you are member
  - A Python Script to like & retweet the first 10 searches on twitter with the word AWS

- **Future**
- Using Python Selenium build an Instagram bot that comments automatically on posts based to the different hashtags we want. The bot will scrape only most recent posts from any hashtag and send comments in each of them. Bot will have the account rotation feature so it will change accounts every 6 comment.
